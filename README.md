# Carla Kroll's Portfolio Site
### this is the progress being developed on my Site

Its tough to design something for yourself, and I struggles with a design concept for weeks.
Finally, I came up with the idea to use my first codepen that I did for #vetswhocode.

I really liked the graphic I developed using one of my dogs and I have decided to make her my mascot/logo moving forward.
I redeveloped a static graphic with her and coded in the cloud animations. I modified the concept slightly, giving the static clouds a little motion, floating up and down in place while 2 other clouds float by on an infinite loop.
This will be the hero section of my site.

Below, I've sectioned of 4 spots for brief bio blurbs. Myself, my dogs, my family, and my hobbies.
My goal is to keep the site clean and easy to navigate.

The website has a lot of work ahead of it, as I intend to incorporate more of what I am learning.
